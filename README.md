**Travel Agency Management System**

This repository contains the implementation of a software system designed for travel agencies to efficiently manage their travel packages, itineraries, and passengers. The system is implemented in Java, adhering to the specified guidelines and providing the following key features:

**Specifications**
Travel Package Management:

Each travel package has a name, passenger capacity, itinerary (list of destinations), and a list of its passengers.
Destinations include a name and a list of available activities.
Activities are defined by a name, description, cost, and capacity, available at specific destinations.
Passenger Categories:

Passengers are categorized as standard, gold, or premium.
Standard passengers have a balance, deducting the activity cost from their balance during sign-up.
Gold passengers receive a 10% discount on activity costs, deducted from their balance.
Premium passengers can sign up for activities for free.
Functionality:

Print itinerary of the travel package, including package name, destinations, and details of activities available at each destination.
Print the passenger list of the travel package, including package name, passenger capacity, number of enrolled passengers, and details of each passenger.
Print details of an individual passenger, including name, passenger number, balance (if applicable), and a list of signed-up activities.
Print details of activities with available spaces, including the number of spaces available.
